# KatiKamuPS
A school management system for KatiKamu Primary School built in java using swing class and JDBC.

Teachers can login, register students, register marks for the students they teach and also logout.
The students can login, view their marks in a table, view their timetable and also logout.
We added an extra user called admin to create time tables for different classes.

The workflow starts after editting the Trail.java file to create databases and the tables, then run home.java to start using the applicatipn.
